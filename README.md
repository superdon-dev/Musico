# Musico
## Search the world of music
### What is it about?
Musico is a school team project as web application for searching songs and albums. You can add listen to your favorite music, preview albums and create your own playlist.

### How it is made?
Musico is developed in React (typescript) as a frontend with reusable components and .NET as a backend using GraphQL for manipulation with the data fetched from the official Spotify API. It also uses Redux for managing the global application data. The design is custom, all elements are pure, stylized in CSS using modern design techniques. 

### Is the app deployed?
The application is not deployed in the moment but it will be very soon so you can preview one of my favorite school projects.
